  <p>Machine learning plays a major role from past years
in image detection, spam reorganization, normal speech
command, product recommendation and medical diagnosis.
Present machine learning algorithm helps us in enhancing
security alerts, ensuring public safety and improve medical
enhancements. Machine learning system also provides better
customer service and safer automobile systems. In the present
paper we discuss about the prediction of future housing prices
that is generated by machine learning algorithm. For the
selection of prediction methods we compare and explore various
prediction methods. We utilize lasso regression as our model
because of its adaptable and probabilistic methodology on model
selection. Our result exhibit that our approach of the issue need
to be successful, and has the ability to process predictions that
would be comparative with other house cost prediction models.
More over on other hand housing value indices, the advancement
of a housing cost prediction that tend to the advancement of real
estate policies schemes. This study utilizes machine learning
algorithms as a research method that develops housing price
prediction models. We create a housing cost prediction model In
view of machine learning algorithm models for example,
XGBoost, lasso regression and neural system on look at their
order precision execution. We in that point recommend a housing
cost prediction model to support a house vender or a real estate
agent for better information based on the valuation of house.
Those examinations exhibit that lasso regression algorithm, in
view of accuracy, reliably outperforms alternate models in the
execution of housing cost prediction</p>
